        <p>
            We've reach 2 months na hehehe. I am really excited and happy of what will be our journey through out the year. Let's recap what we've done this month. I introduce you to my family, we've exchange gifts, letters, a lot of eating fast food, home cook, street food, and anything else. You have tried Korean barbecue as well plus with my family, we watch yuan compete sa Karate poo. I am so happy because I know our relationship last till forever. It really feels that we know each other for a long time but I just met you 5 months ago in a class called game development. I know sometimes i did not say goodnight to you every night because i fell asleep always po I'm sorry poo for falling asleep po my lovess ko po. Thank you everyday for nonstop caring, loving, excitement, EVERYTHING. You are literally the best girlfriend in my life. ^.^ mwaaa mwaaa mwaaa. We've been through a lot this month we got nervous, excitement, happyness, sadness, but all of that is memorable because without that we would not grow and learn from it. I will cherish and protect you always <span class="a">my babiii</span>, <span class="b">my babuuuu</span>, <span class="c">my loveeee</span>, <span class="d">my babyyyy</span>, <span class="e">mi ladyyy</span>, <span class="f">mon amourr</span>, <span class="g">my woman</span>, <span class="h">my boss</span>.
